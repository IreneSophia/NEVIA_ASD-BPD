# ML_BPD-ASD

The folders `crosschannel`, `speech` and `video` contain the scripts for preprocessing and extracting the features. Each folder contains additional information for the respective modality. 

The folder `SVM_classifier` contains all scripts and data as well as the SVMs run in NeuroMiner. Since some of the data is too large for GitHub, it is uploaded on [OSF](https://osf.io/y8xbp). 

Last, this folder also contains some helper scripts and RMarkdown files to create the results section of the manuscript and the supplementary materials. One should be able to run these if the whole repository is downloaded.
